# Dianping_Crawler

This crawler is able to help me crawl the publicly viewable information of a user or a venue in Dazhong Dianping (http://www.dianping.com/aboutus). 

== Before Installation ==

We have tested our crawler on Ubuntu (version: 14.04). Please make sure that you have installed Python2.7 and Selenium Webdriver.

== User Crawler == 

Usage:

- Before running crawler, create a new subfolder named 'Data' inside 'User_Crawler' folder.

- Change directory to User_Crawler, and edit begin_ID, end_ID, and step in dianping_u_script.py.

- Run it using bash command like 'python dianping_u_script.py'.

- When it is done, you can find your data in 'User_Crawler/Data' folder.

== Venue Crawler ==

Will be released soon.
